Hello. Welcome to my personal website and blog, hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Special thanks to [@JordanAlimi](https://github.com/JordanAlimi) for informing me about GitHub Pages when I was talking to him about building my own personal site and blog. Free hosting just can't be beaten. I can't wait to learn more about Jekyll and authoring posts with Markdown is pretty awesome. It's actually a lot easier to do than I thought it would be.
