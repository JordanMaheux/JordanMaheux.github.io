<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>

I am a young mind residing in Montréal, Québec, Canada.
I recently graduated from the <a href="http://www.johnabbott.qc.ca/academics/career-programs/computer-science-technology/">John Abbott College Computer Science Career Program</a>, which gives me all the technical skills and know-how to meet or exceed industry standards.
I work hard and try to learn something new every day.
I love the Internet, computers, problem-solving, coding, designing, testing, and building things.
I am dedicated to the field of computer science and passionate about web development.

<h2>What do you do?</h2>

I create things with my imagination.
I want to build web sites and applications that simplify our daily lives and improve quality of life for everyone.
I focus on the user experience, ease-of-use, and accessibility for all.
Lately I have been working on my personal projects, such as this site and my OpenShift site.
I read about existing and emerging technologies.

<h2>What do you enjoy?</h2>
I have interests in many things. Too many things to put here. Here is a sample size of things I like:
<ul>
  <li>A comfy chair and a choice keyboard that I can spend hours coding with.</li>
  <li>Listening to and producing music.</li>
  <li>The process of engineering, designing, and developing software.</li>
</ul>
